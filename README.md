## Description

This application fetches data from the Binance API and displays it in a tabular format using Ag-Grid. The table provides information about various trading pairs, including price changes, percentage change, weighted average price, and trading volumes coming from the Binance API endpoint `/api/v1/exchangeInfo`.

### Parsing of Symbols

The trading pair symbols are parsed to provide a more user-friendly and descriptive representation in the table. The `formatSymbolCell` function is used to map the raw symbols from the API to human-readable trading pair names. For example, the symbol `BTCUSDT` is displayed as `BTC â‡„ USDT`, where `BTC` is the base asset and `USDT` is the quote asset. To obtain symbols' base and quote assets, the Binance API endpoint `/api/v1/exchangeInfo` is used. In case of an error while fetching or if the symbol couldn't be found in this endpoint, the raw symbol from `/api/v3/ticker/24hr` will be used.
